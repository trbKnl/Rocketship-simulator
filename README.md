# Rocketship-simulator
Bored? Try me now!
Not the rocketship simulator we need, but the rocketship simulator we deserve!
It's so much fun! It really is.

Usage:
rocketship.sh -m "Hi Boss! I am getting a cup of coffee!"

The Rocketship flies through space! Leaving nothing but fuel and galaxies behind!
